### Performance Evaluation of Face Recognition Algorithms

**Introduction**

In this project performed a performance evaluation of the three face recognition models. 

The first model is implemented using MTCNN by me(https://github.com/nadidebeyza/face-recognition-performance-eval/blob/main/Google%20Colabs./face_recognition_1.ipynb). 

The second model is implemented with Haar Cascading using OpenCV by Dev Dash(https://github.com/nadidebeyza/face-recognition-performance-eval/blob/main/Google%20Colabs./face_recognition_2.ipynb). 

Finally the third model is implemented using a pre-trained model by Adrian Rosebrock(https://github.com/nadidebeyza/face-recognition-performance-eval/blob/main/Google%20Colabs./face_recognition_3.ipynb). Next section explains the models' structures.

MTCNN is a python (pip) library created by Github user ipacz that implements Zhang, Kaipeng, et alarticle. .'s "Multitask Cascaded Convolutional Networks for Joint Face Detection and Alignment." IEEE Signal Processing Letters, vol. 23, no. 10 (October 2016), pp. 1499â€“1503. Crossref. I prefer to use MTCNN because it is an extremely accurate and reliable algorithm. Even with varying sizes, lighting, and severe rotations, it correctly recognises faces. Face recognition with OpenCV is quick and accurate thanks to a pre-trained deep learning face detector model included with the library. OpenCV comes with pre-trained Haar cascades that may be used for face detection right out of the box. Since OpenCV 3.3, a deep learning-based face detector has been included in the library.
