**Introduction**

In our project, we used the Tensorflow library. Tensorflow has a pre-trained model called “qna” which gives answers to questions of a given text. The model has trained with SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) dataset which contains articles from Wikipedia and question-answer pairs with them. It also uses BERT transformers.
